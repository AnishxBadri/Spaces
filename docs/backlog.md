# Backlog

Full bodies of the open slices, the repo copy of their Linear issues. Linear issues get archived once shipped, so this file is what keeps an open spec readable. Amend a body here and in Linear together. When a slice ships, delete its body here; the bodies of every shipped slice of projects 14–29 are in git at `1860d2c` (`git show 1860d2c:docs/roadmap-backlog.md`).

## 31. Edges and icons, and the AI shape

Slices of Linear project P-SPA-35, "31. Edges and the AI shape". `edges-1` (SPA-387), `ai-a` (SPA-388) and `notes-1` (SPA-391) shipped 2026-11-10; `edges-2` (SPA-392), `record-1` (SPA-393) and `settings-1` (SPA-394) shipped 2026-11-11 (the owner's option D: the 24px edge, the bone ground, one ink folder; the record's unboxed rail and long text; settings in group cards). `ai-b` is the one slice left and carries the migration.

#### `ai-b` (SPA-389) · hitl · M · migration — The mandate in every judging lane, and cached tokens on the ledger

**Blocked by:** `ai-a`. **Owns** `lib/ai/complete.ts` (the system part's mandate slot), the judging lanes' callers (`column-run.ts`, `attribute-run.ts`, `read-deck-summarize.ts`, the meeting prep, `propose.ts`'s suggest-spaces), `lib/server/mandate.ts`, `packages/db/src/schema/ai.ts`, `routes/_app/settings/usage.tsx`.

**hitl:** the owner has not yet confirmed that AI column answers may change under the mandate. Ask before step 1 and record the answer in `docs/decisions.md`.

**What to build.**

1. **The mandate in judging lanes.** A `renderMandate` (pure, `packages/core`) prints the mandate's facts as a short block. `completeProgram` puts it in the system part after the lane instructions, before the cache marker, for the judging lanes only: AI columns, meeting prep, summaries (`read-deck-summarize`), suggest spaces. Mechanical lanes (extract, classify, embed, vision text) never see it. With no mandate recorded, the block is absent and the prefix is unchanged.
2. **`tokens_cached`.** Migration: `ai_usage.tokens_cached integer` nullable (and the same on `ai_run`'s step usage if it carries tokens). `completeProgram` writes `usage.tokensCached` from `ai-a`.
3. **Usage page.** `settings/usage.tsx`: the Tokens readout gains the cached share (`Cached · 41%` when any run has it); the run table's tokens cell reads `in (cached) / out`; `tokens()` handles null.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] A judging lane's system part contains the mandate block when a mandate exists and not otherwise; a mechanical lane's never does (tests per lane).
- [ ] The prefix stays byte-identical across rows with the mandate in it (test).
- [ ] Migration adds `tokens_cached`; `boot.test.ts` green; `ai_usage` rows carry it after an Anthropic call.
- [ ] Usage page prints the cached share and per-run cached count (render test).
- [ ] Gates: typecheck, test, lint, prettier; web build; `boot.test.ts` alone.

## 16. A published image anyone can run

#### `ship-10` · afk · M — Install, upgrade and rollback docs — back up first, pin the tag, never lose MASTER_KEY

**Blocked by:** `ship-3`, `ship-5`, `ship-8`

**What to build**

Three recorded decisions have no written home and all three are standing debt. README is still the TanStack Start template's ('Welcome to your new TanStack Start app!', a section on removing Tailwind, Better Auth setup notes) — the front door of a product people are meant to self-host. Write the docs the earlier slices made true, and nothing more. docs/install.md: the compose file pinned to a published tag, the two required env vars and the fact that there are only two, what ./data holds, the setup token printed to the logs, and the HTTPS overlay as step two. docs/upgrade.md: back up with scripts/backup.sh, pull, up — and the reason, which is now enforced rather than requested, because an older image refuses a newer database. The MASTER_KEY warning appears in bold in three places saying the same sentence, per CONTEXT's 'docs must say this in bold'. The ./data ownership paragraph must tell the truth after ship-2: the entrypoint repairs it, and `chown -R 1000:1000 ./data` is only needed when the container is pinned to a non-root user. Every command in these docs is run once by a human against a clean box, and no command that was not run appears.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] README is the product's front door: what Spaces is, the compose quickstart pinned to a published tag, links to install and upgrade — and none of the TanStack template's remaining sections
- [ ] docs/install.md covers: compose from a pinned tag, DATABASE_URL and APP_URL as the only required vars, what lives in ./data, the first-run setup token from the logs, then the TLS overlay
- [ ] docs/upgrade.md covers: backup → pull → up; the bold statement that an older image now refuses a newer database and that the way back is restore, never a downgrade; and the psql two-liner for the dealos→spaces role/database rename
- [ ] The MASTER_KEY sentence appears in bold in install, upgrade and backup sections, identically worded: lose ./data/secret.key and every stored credential is unrecoverable
- [ ] The ownership paragraph matches ship-2's behaviour — the entrypoint repairs ./data; the chown line is documented only for containers pinned to a non-root user
- [ ] Every command in both documents was executed against a clean box by a human, and the PR says so; no untested command appears
- [ ] docs/architecture.md hosting lines are re-pointed at these documents instead of repeating them
- [ ] Explicitly out of scope and named as such: the comparison page, the PaaS templates, and the marketing site
- [ ] Full gate pass: tsc, vitest green, lint zero, prettier

**Demo** — Hand someone the README who has never seen the repository: they get a running, HTTPS-served instance from a published tag, know what to back up, and know what happens if they lose secret.key — without asking a question.

**Spec** — CONTEXT.md — BYOK ('Losing it makes every stored key unrecoverable — docs must say this in bold'); CONTEXT.md — Hostability decisions #5 and #6; Standing debt ('Rollback is unsafe and undocumented', './data ownership landmine'); README.md (still the TanStack Start template)

#### `ship-12` · afk · S — One-click templates — Coolify, Railway, Render, Unraid

**Blocked by:** `ship-10`, `ship-8`

**What to build**

CONTEXT's Hosting rules end with 'Publish Coolify / Railway / Render / Unraid templates. Cheap, huge reach — that's where self-hosters live', and nothing owns it. Once there is a published tag and a written install doc, each template is a small declarative file wrapping the same two-container shape. The one thing that actually breaks these platforms is the database: we need pgvector, and only some managed Postgres offerings have it — Render's does, Railway needs the pgvector image variant. A template that provisions a plain Postgres fails at the first migration, so each one either provisions pgvector or says plainly that it cannot. Two other rules: APP_URL comes from the platform's assigned domain (a template that leaves it unset reproduces the Secure-cookie login loop on a platform that always terminates TLS), and ./data must be a persistent volume or every restart loses secret.key and with it every stored credential.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Templates under deploy/ for Coolify, Railway, Render and Unraid, each pinning a published tag and never `latest`
- [ ] Each provisions Postgres with pgvector, or states in its description that the platform cannot and is unsupported — no template fails at the first migration
- [ ] APP_URL is wired to the platform's assigned domain in every template, and a deployed instance sets a Secure cookie on login
- [ ] ./data is a persistent volume in every template, and each description carries the backup-and-secret.key sentence from ship-10
- [ ] Each template is deployed once by a human and the resulting URL reaches /setup with the token retrievable from that platform's log view — a template whose setup token is unreachable is a broken install and is fixed or dropped here
- [ ] The README links the templates and says which platforms were actually tested and when
- [ ] Full gate pass: tsc, vitest green, lint zero, prettier

**Demo** — Deploy from the Railway template, wait, open the assigned URL, read the setup token out of the platform's logs, and finish the wizard — a working instance with no terminal involved.

**Spec** — CONTEXT.md — Hosting ('Publish Coolify / Railway / Render / Unraid templates. Cheap, huge reach'); CONTEXT.md — Hostability decisions #6 (frozen required-env set), Two self-host auth traps #1 and #2; docker-compose.yml (the two-container shape the templates wrap)
